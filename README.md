My CapStone Project about recipe time estimation

## Abstract

In this project, I am going to build a recipe recommendation system that automatically extracts key words from online recipes and tries to estimate the time cost for the recipes, so that the system can recommend to the user a recipe that meets the user’s time constraint. Also, since the key words are collected from the recipe, the user can filter the selections by choosing cuisine type, dish type, absent / provided ingredients, and so on. A web app will be created for test and illustration purpose.

## Motivation

The motivation is from my own experience. After I came to the bootcamp, the common time when I left Galvanize was after 6:30 PM. And I also need to take 45-minute bus ride to go back to the place I live. So I usually arrived at home at around 8 PM, hungry and exhausted. I didn’t want to spend too much time cooking, and there were not too many ingredients left in the refrigerator. So it was difficult to figure out something I like and won’t cost me too much time to prepare.
Most of the online recipes do not have a time estimate. People usually need do the estimation based on their experience. I am going to create a model to predict the time giving a recipe, and recommend one recipe that costs less time than the user-specified time limit.
